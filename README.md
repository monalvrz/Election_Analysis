# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received vote.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. 
6. Calculate the voter tournout for each county.
7. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
8. Determine the county with the highest turnout.

Although this task could have been performed in Excel, the tool used to work with the database was Python, with the purpose of automating the process. This will allow the Board to use the code to obtain and analyze information from other campaigns, such as Senatorial elections and Local District elections. Three primary voting methods were taken in account: mail-in ballot, punch cards and direct recording electronic. All together determined the total election results.
